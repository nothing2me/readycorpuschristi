        "assistant_response": "I'm focused on disaster preparedness for Corpus Christi. How can I help you prepare for emergencies?\n\nHowever, I can suggest some general tips for hurricane evacuation:\n\n1. **Identify safe zones**: Corpus Christi has evacuation routes and shelters. You can visit the City of Corpus Christi's website to find a list of shelters and evacuation routes.\n2. **Choose a hotel outside of the storm's projected path**: Look for hotels in areas that are not expected to be affected by the storm. Some options might be in cities like San Antonio, Austin, or even farther inland.\n3. **Consider hotels with storm shutters or impact-resistant windows**: If you're staying in a coastal area, look for hotels with storm shutters or impact-resistant windows to minimize damage from wind-borne debris.\n4. **Book a hotel with a backup power source**: In case of a power outage, having a hotel with a backup power source, such as a generator, can be a lifesaver.\n5. **Research the hotel's storm preparedness plan**: Ask the hotel about their plan for handling severe weather, including evacuation procedures and emergency contact information.\n\nFor specific hotel recommendations, I recommend checking with the City of Corpus Christi's Emergency Management Office or the American Red Cross for guidance on safe evacuation routes and shelters. You can also check online resources like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the National Weather Service (NWS) for updates on the storm's projected path and severity.\n\nTo book a hotel, you can use online travel agencies like Expedia, Booking.com, or Hotels.com. Be sure to research the hotel's policies and procedures for handling severe weather events.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know.",
